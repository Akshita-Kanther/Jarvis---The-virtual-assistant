# Jarvis---The-virtual-assistant

The main task of a voice assistant is to minimize the use of input devices like keyboard, mouse, touch pens, etc.
This will reduce both the hardware cost and space taken by it.
The voice assistant we have developed is a desktop-based built using python modules and libraries. 
This assistant is just a basic version that could perform all the basic tasks which have been mentioned. 
The functionalities or basic tasks include , It can send emails, It can read PDF, It can send text on WhatsApp, It can open command prompt, your favorite IDE, notepad etc., It can play music, It can do Wikipedia searches for you, It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser, It can give desktop reminders of your choice. 
It can have some basic conversation.
As we know Python is an emerging language so it becomes easy to write a script for Voice Assistant in Python. 
The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user.
Speech recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. 
In Python there is an API called Speech-Recognition which allows us to convert speech into text. 
It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. It became easier to send emails without typing any word, Searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your favorite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time.
Now the basic question arises in mind that how it is an AI? The virtual assistant that I have created is like if it is not an A.I, but it is the output of a bundle of the statement. But fundamentally, the main purpose of A.I machines is that it can perform human tasks with the same efficiency or even more efficiently than humans. It is a fact that my virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.
